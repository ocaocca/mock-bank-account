# mock-bank-account

this repository is supposed to have APIs that can show bank accounts and also details of each bank accounts. 
it is not finnised yet, but definitely will later in the futere. 
and if you are interested you can also read my other repositories!

it has many flaws, one of which is I can't seem to find the problem why my req.body cannot be read so all I got are Id and v from mongoDB. If you know why, please please reach me out here. 

Many thanks!
